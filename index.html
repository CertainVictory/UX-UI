                        With DNA sourced directly from the legendary 2000 GT, each and every Supra has shared the same core fundamentals: a smooth inline six up front, Rear-Wheel Drive and a modern chassis. As Toyota's purest expression of performance, Supra has redefined the sports car time and time again. And as we prepare to launch the next chapter of Supra, let’s revisit the past to see how the marque evolved from grand tourer to pure driver’s car. With its sensuous bodywork, athletic stance and expressive, jewel-like LED headlights, the 2020 GR Supra is a stunning work of art. But it’s the science behind the design that makes this car a true masterpiece. Up front, its wide grille is designed to channel cool air directly to the turbocharged engine, helping optimize performance. Up top, its “double-bubble” roof adds space inside while reducing aerodynamic drag outside. And its flared rear spoiler does more than make a dramatic statement—it helps reduce body lift and helps keep Supra planted when running at speed.
